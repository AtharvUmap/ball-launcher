# Ball-Launcher
Made as a part of the Udemy Course, **Unity C# Mobile Game Development: Make 3 Games From Scratch.**

This repository provides the implentation of a 2D Ball Launcher in Unity. There is a ball that can been shot at different angles in speeds in order to knock down a tower. This utilises the Unity physics and collision system in order to make the ball move with the projectile motion, and then collide with the tower.
